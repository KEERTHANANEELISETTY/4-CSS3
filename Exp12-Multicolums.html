        <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
             It defines the content and structure of web content. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local 
             storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and 
             originally included cues for its appearance.HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, 
             images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to 
             create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, 
             quotes, and other items.</p>
